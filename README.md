Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview:
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project is designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to build a robust model that can accurately classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent, helping financial institutions prevent fraud and minimize losses.

The project leverages a dataset of credit card transactions, which includes both genuine and fraudulent transactions. Various machine learning algorithms are applied to detect patterns and anomalies that might indicate fraudulent behavior0.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset for machine learning algorithms.

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features for better model accuracy.

Model Building: Train various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model performance.

Real-time Prediction: The trained model can be used to predict fraud in real-time transactions.

Dataset:


The dataset used in this project contains credit card transaction data with the following columns:

Time: Time in seconds.

V1 - V28: Anonymized features generated by the credit card processing system.

Amount: The transaction amount.

Class: A binary label indicating if the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

Technologies Used:


Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)

TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
